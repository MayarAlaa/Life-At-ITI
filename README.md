# Life-At-ITI

**So, I quitted my job because I got accepted at ITI الحمد لله. I'm so excited .This is a new chapter in my life. A new adventure I've chosen. Not an easy one though.
I'll be studying web development and business intelligence from October 2019 to the end of June 2020 inshaAllah.** 


# Week 10 :
I feel exhausted. I need to re-energize myself. I was able to hide the panic I felt at every team meeting for the projects we're assigned. I know I need pretty long time to build my self-confidence again. I feel happy when I suggest something about the project, I mean I don't remain silent because this time it's supposed to be different from college time. I study, I work hard. I'm trying to do my best. These days I'm tired and I want to save everything around me before falling apart.
We're done with the advanced JavaScript course and we started a 3-day XML course.

# Week 9 : Our first project 
We're done with the advanced SQL course and we're assigned our first project to be delivered in two weeks. I'm excited and afraid. 
We had an exam in OOP .I think I did better in this exam  compared to the C exam. 
I'm still not good at JS. One important thing I learned is that I should read the lecture on the same day after going home, otherwise the info will evaporate.

# Week 8 :
It was a very tiring week. I was really exhausted.
I want to be good at JavaScript.
I'm not satisfied with my level in it.
We started the advanced SQL course.

# Week 7 :
We've finished the OOP with C++ course. And I totally related to Aristotle's saying: "The more you know, the more you know that you don't know". I started to be convinced that online courses are never enough. A good start, definitely yes but your knowledge will be  limited by their authors knowlegde. Maybe at work, you'll be using what you've learnt in the online course only and learn more by facing problems, but still I think there will be always something missing. Reading books is a "longer path" ,maybe a bit boring but will make me a strong developer I guess..That's one thing I realised this week.

Another thing I realised that I don't want to stay in the same workplace for a decade. Changing workplaces, changing teammates mean *diversity* for me. Diversity in forming my ideas and experiences.

Last thing, in 2016 I heard about the imposter syndrome for the first time in Goto Berlin conference. I have that syndrome but back then I didn't realise it or know that it existed.Today, I gave a presentation about imposter syndrome. Many of my mates at ITI also have this syndrome but didn't know its name as well or that it is something common among us. I hope I transferred useful knowledge to them.


# Week 6 : *Sigh of despair*
I still panic anytime I'm asked to present something in front of my teammates. At the end of the week, I'm supposed to do a 15-minute presentation on any topic I choose. I haven't chosen the topic yet.

I had a exam in C. I didn't do well. I wasn't sure of most of my answers. But the exam made me realize that I need to change my way of studying a little bit. I should understand the reason of the compilation errors I meet ,give more and nore attention to every line of code I write down in the assignments. This would need much more time which I don't have.

I promise myself to do my best.


# Week 5 : 
Last week, we started a course in client-side technologies. We studied HTML and CSS. I preferred writing C way more than writing HTML and CSS. I know they're easier but they seemed overwhelming to me at the beginning and I was too slow in doing the assignments. I need practice, I know that. That's why I decided to re-visit *The Web Developer Bootcamp course* to study HTML and CSS and do the assignments because after I had bought the course, I never had the time to do it and it's a great opportunity to do it now.

We started another course in object oriented programming with C++ and I felt I'm back in my comfort zone again.

I wonder ,will I be able to feel comfortable,  raise my hand and ask questions..etc. with strangers like I do now with my colleagues or it's just because I got used to them??


# Week 4 : 8 months left !!
Last week we had our first English session . It was good . The instructor divided us into teams of 2 , each team gave a presentation about a topic and she gave us little time to prepare which was challenging and exciting.

In addition to that , we took a 4-day course about communication skills . It was terrific !
The instructor literally pushed me out of my comfort zone . I raised my hand, answered questions, shared my opinion many times. We did lots of presentations without having much time to prepare. The course itself was very very informative. I loved it so much and I loved the instructor. I hope she gives us other courses in the upcoming 8 months .

One of the most amazing things we did in that course is the debates. In my daily life, I usually avoid debates even the trivial ones. During my debate, I felt uncomfortable.It was really frightening seeing the opposite team taking notes while I'm speaking to reply to what I had said. But I feel proud that I did something totally against of who I am. I hope to repeat the debates experience again.

On the last day of the week, we had a funday to meet people from other tracks . It was a wonderful day, we played, ate, sang and LAUGHED A LOT.


# Week 3 : 
Last week, we finished **intro to programming using C** course. I think it is my first time to truly understand what pointers are and apply on the concept. I learned so much from this course. 

We've also finished a 3-day course in software engineering. I studied software engineering at college three years ago but I didn't enjoy it back then that much. The thing I liked most about the course is that the instructor while explaining software engineering concepts, he was mentioning realistic examples, like funny/bad situations we meet everyday at work or he had personally met. And since I've worked as software developer for a year before joining ITI, I felt I could relate so much. Everything seemed to be clearer. I'm now working on building the **puzzle**.

Three **fantastic** things happened last week:
1) I raised my hand in the class of software engineering to answer questions and share my opinion.
2) We did a presentation on a topic that I've never heard of before and we had so little time to prepare.
3) It rained heavily but I'm not going to mention the details of that strange day XD XD.



# Week 2 : Hello World! wait.....WHAT??
Last week, we finished the database fundamentals course. I'm really grateful الحمد لله that I've joined ITI. I realised that there are some "fundamentals" that I wouldn't be able to learn on my own, not when I'm starting my career anyway. I might gain the knowledge ,yes but from years of experience not because I decided to sit down and study for instance "windows authentication" vs "sql server authentication".

We started another course: Intro to programming using C and yes I printed "Hello World!" .The instructor is amazing. I'm now learning what's happening behind the scenes.

I only have one problem which I hope I solve : *SHYNESS* .I'm too shy to raise my hand and ask questions. I know I'm missing a lot. 


# Week 1 : A WHOLE NEW WOOOORLD
 We started our adventure by a course in database fundamentals.
 
 Since day 1 I realized 3 things :
 
 1) Learning for me is like a huge puzzle.I gathered a great number of the puzzle pieces during college and mostly during my job as a software developer.
   but I haven't built that puzzle yet. 
   I had learned many things through the tasks I was assigned at work, but most of the time I knew the WHAT not the WHY .
   In ITI I started learning the "WHY" behind the code I write.
   
 2) A comfort zone I'm locking myself up in is studying for the sake of grades not for the sake of learning. I need to get out of that zone.
   Actually, this zone isn't comforting but rather suffocating. The instructors, the materials, the practice I'll be provided with at ITI are 
   great but it all depends on me at the end.
   
 3) I need to park my car at a safer place because its battery was stolen and it was a really great thing to end my week with XD XD.
