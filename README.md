# Life-At-ITI

So, الحمد لله,I quitted my job because I got accepted at ITI. I'm so excited .This is a new chapter in my life. A new adventure I've chosen. Not an easy one though.
I'll be studying web development and business intelligence from October 2019 to the end of June 2020 inshaAllah. 


# Week 1 : A WHOLE NEW WOOOORLD
 We started our adventure by a course in database fundamentals.
 
 Since day 1 I realized 3 things :
 
 1) Learning for me is like a huge puzzle.I gathered a great number of the puzzle pieces during college and mostly during my job as a software developer.
   but I haven't built that puzzle yet. 
   I had learned many things through the tasks I was assigned at work, but most of the time I knew the WHAT not the WHY .
   In ITI I started learning the "WHY" behind the code I write.
   
 2) A comfort zone I'm locking myself up in is studying for the sake of grades not for the sake of learning. I need to get out of that zone.
   Actually, this zone isn't comforting but rather suffocating. The instructors, the materials, the practice I'll be provided with at ITI are 
   great but it all depends on me at the end.
   
 3) I need to park my car at a safer place because its battery was stolen and it was a really great thing to end my week with XD XD.
