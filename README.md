# Life-At-ITI

So, الحمد لله,I quitted my job because I got accepted at ITI. I'm so excited .This is a new chapter in my life. A new adventure I've chosen. Not an easy one though.
I'll be studying web development and business intelligence from October 2019 to the end of June 2020 inshaAllah. 



# Week 4 : 8 months left !!
Last week we had our first English session . It was good . The instructor divided us into teams of 2 , each team gave a presentation about a topic and she gave us little time to prepare which was challenging and exciting.

In addition to that , we took a 4-day course about communication skills . It was terrific !
The instructor literally pushed me out of my comfort zone . I raised my hand, answered questions, shared my opinion many times. We did lots of presentations without having much time to prepare. The course itself was very very informative. I loved it so much and I loved the instructor. I hope she gives us other courses in the upcoming 8 months .

One of the most amazing things we did in that course is the debates. In my daily life, I usually avoid debates even the trivial ones. During my debate, I felt uncomfortable.It was really frightening seeing the opposite team taking notes while I'm speaking to reply to what I had said. But I feel proud that I did something totally against of who I am. I hope to repeat the debates experience again.

On the last day of the week, we had a funday to meet people from other tracks . It was a wonderful day, we played, ate, sang and LAUGHED A LOT.


# Week 3 : 
Last week, we finished **intro to programming using C** course. I think it is my first time to truly understand what pointers are and apply on the concept. I learned so much from this course. 

We've also finished a 3-day course in software engineering. I studied software engineering at college three years ago but I didn't enjoy it back then that much. The thing I liked most about the course is that the instructor while explaining software engineering concepts, he was mentioning realistic examples, like funny/bad situations we meet everyday at work or he had personally met. And since I've worked as software developer for a year before joining ITI, I felt I could relate so much. Everything seemed to be clearer. I'm now working on building the **puzzle**.

Three **fantastic** things happened last week:
1) I raised my hand in the class of software engineering to answer questions and share my opinion.
2) We did a presentation on a topic that I've never heard of before and we had so little time to prepare.
3) It rained heavily but I'm not going to mention the details of that strange day XD XD.



# Week 2 : Hello World! wait.....WHAT??
Last week, we finished the database fundamentals course. I'm really grateful الحمد لله that I've joined ITI. I realised that there are some "fundamentals" that I wouldn't be able to learn on my own, not when I'm starting my career anyway. I might gain the knowledge ,yes but from years of experience not because I decided to sit down and study for instance "windows authentication" vs "sql server authentication".

We started another course: Intro to programming using C and yes I printed "Hello World!" .The instructor is amazing. I'm now learning what's happening behind the scenes.

I only have one problem which I hope I solve : *SHYNESS* .I'm too shy to raise my hand and ask questions. I know I'm missing a lot. 


# Week 1 : A WHOLE NEW WOOOORLD
 We started our adventure by a course in database fundamentals.
 
 Since day 1 I realized 3 things :
 
 1) Learning for me is like a huge puzzle.I gathered a great number of the puzzle pieces during college and mostly during my job as a software developer.
   but I haven't built that puzzle yet. 
   I had learned many things through the tasks I was assigned at work, but most of the time I knew the WHAT not the WHY .
   In ITI I started learning the "WHY" behind the code I write.
   
 2) A comfort zone I'm locking myself up in is studying for the sake of grades not for the sake of learning. I need to get out of that zone.
   Actually, this zone isn't comforting but rather suffocating. The instructors, the materials, the practice I'll be provided with at ITI are 
   great but it all depends on me at the end.
   
 3) I need to park my car at a safer place because its battery was stolen and it was a really great thing to end my week with XD XD.
